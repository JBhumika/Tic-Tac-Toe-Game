# TicTacToe

## Overview

TicTacToe is a game that allows players to play against each other or against the computer. The game has a graphical user interface (GUI) and four options: user vs user, user vs CPU (where the CPU plays randomly), user vs AI, and CPU vs AI. Once the user clicks on the "start game" button, they can choose any of the four options and make their moves by clicking on the grid buttons. If the user is playing, they can enter their name. The first player to get three spaces in a row/column or diagonally wins the game. After the game ends, the user can start a new game by clicking on any of the options.
